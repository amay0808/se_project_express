# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

WTWR (What to Wear?) is a powerful application designed to assist users in choosing their daily outfits based on weather conditions and personal style preferences. This repository hosts the back-end server and API of the WTWR application, providing a streamlined conduit for client-side requests and secure, efficient interaction with the application's database.

## Functionality

- User authorization and authentication, facilitating a personalized experience.
- Management of user profile data and outfit preferences.
- Provision of outfit recommendations based on weather data and user inputs.
- Execution of CRUD operations relating to users and their respective data.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- Node.js for the server-side runtime environment.
- Express.js for the web application framework.
- MongoDB as a NoSQL database for storing user data.
- Mongoose for object data modeling and easy interaction with MongoDB.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.
- bcrypt.js for password hashing, ensuring user data security.
- Jest for unit testing and maintaining code health.

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the following commands in your terminal:

- `npm run start` — to launch the server.
- `npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature, ideal for development.

## Testing

Before committing your code, ensure to update the `sprint.txt` file in the root directory. This file should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on (e.g., 12). It's crucial to keep this file up-to-date for effective project tracking and version control.

## Deployment

Details for deployment will be added as the project progresses and reaches the production phase.
